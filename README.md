# Retarded-potentials

Problem statement: 
Two particles of with equal magnitude but opposite charges at infinity, 
acclerate towards eachother and collide at t=0s and anhilate.
What would the electric field look like at t seconds after the collision?

The code tries to give a qualitative approximation of the fields 
without actually solving for the equation for retarded potentials.
